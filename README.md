##  Progress Escort | Next JS Application

This application was built using Next JS Framework.

I used a few libraries to help me with the development process and now I will give a brief explanation of why I choose these libraries.
___

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- add types on our components

[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- add styles around of our components

[Context API](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)
- to handle w/ the data around of the app using flux architecture

Storage
- to keep the last actions from the user saved. (We used this to rehydrate the store)

[GraphQL Request](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request)
- to do requests for the API

### How to run:

```shellscript 
  $ yarn install
```

```shellscript 
  $ yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
